Google colab works on VM in google's servers
so we need to connect colab and drive for accessing drive files for that we use MOUNTING
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
content - main workspace in colab
attach my google drive in the folder drive inside content
then we access the files in MY DRIVE

next for directly downloading datasets from kaggle we need opendatasets
so install opendatasets
then od.download(link)
it will ask kaggle username , key (setting api key)

kagglehub - library
for dowmloading kaggle dataset

from google import files
importing files from system and reading the csv file

importing pandas
tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras and reading csv file
